                    <h2>Eternals' Celestials Retcons Create Multiple MCU Plot Holes</h2>
                    <p>Eternals finally revealed the truth about the MCU's Celestials - but it doesn't match with any of the setup seen in Guardians of the Galaxy!</p>
                    <p>Marvel's Eternals movie rewrote the origin of the Celestials, and in so doing created something of an MCU plot hole. Created by the legendary Jack Kirby, the Celestials are essentially Marvel's space gods—cosmic beings who travel the universe creating life, and who possess the power to judge entire worlds and civilizations. Visually, Chloe Zhao's Eternals is a beautiful homage to Kirby's artwork, complete with comic-book-accurate CGI beings representing the Celestials.</p>
                    <p>Eternals' vision of the Celestials isn't quite the same as Jack Kirby's, though. It borrows an idea from the classic Earth X miniseries by Alex Ross and Jim Kreuge; there, Earth's heroes learned the Celestials had planted a seed deep inside the Earth, one that had grown and would soon emerge, destroying the world. Eternals refined the idea a little, revealing its Celestials are essentially the ultimate alpha predators, drawing upon the life energy of an inhabited planet for sustenance and then shattering it like an egg when they "Emerge." In the MCU, then, Eternals' final act reveals Celestials create worlds as part of their reproductive process, to serve as incubators for their seeds. The discovery led most of the Eternals to rebel against the space gods, successfully preventing the Emergence that would have destroyed Earth.</p>
                    <p>The core problem is that the MCU has already established some basic facts about the Celestials—most notably in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. These portray the Celestials as one of the oldest races in the galaxy, with the Collector showing footage of a Celestial using the Power Stone to judge an ancient civilization. The only Celestial encountered in the present day is long since dead. The mining station Knowhere has been established inside the severed head of a Celestial. And then, in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the heroes encountered a being who believed himself the last of the Celestials, Ego the Living Planet. Ego was a being of "living light," and claimed he awoke drifting through the cosmos, utterly and entirely alone. He learned to control the molecules around him, creating an entire world to live within, and that began to form avatars for himself. However hard he looked, Ego could never find another Celestial, implying his species had been rendered extinct long ago. Supporting this, the Marvel Studios Visual Dictionary revealed the planet Sakaar—seen in Thor: Ragnarok—was littered with pieces of Celestial corpses. Finally, Avengers: Endgame went on to reveal the planet Vormir - where the Soul Stone is found - is "the center of Celestial civilization."</p>
                    <p>None of this fits with the Celestials seen in Eternals at all. The Celestials of Eternals do not appear to be composed of "living light". Rather, they have a natural form, with Tiamut breaking out of the Earth's crust as a gigantic being. Far from extinct, their seeds have been sown across the entire galaxy, and at least one—Arishem—is at large in the cosmos. Even their powers appear very different to those of Ego—far greater, in fact—because the Celestials manipulate cosmic energy, and hints of their powers are shown through the Eternals, who they have empowered as protectors of their cosmically devastating reproduction process. Even their connection to Vormir is a mystery.</p>
                    <p>There's no easy way to fix this. The most reasonable explanation would be to suggest Ego was mistaken when he considered himself a Celestial, and in fact he is something entirely different—as he is in the comics. Perhaps the Celestials have largely chosen to remove themselves from the universe, existing on some other plane of existence, only entering this dimension to create new worlds and welcome their children into their ranks. Their withdrawal could even have been forced by whoever was responsible for severing the head that became Knowhere, and raining the body parts of Celestials upon Sakaar; perhaps that conflict is also why one Celestial destroyed an inhabited world, when they'd instead be expected to harvest its life energy. All this is an awkward fit, and it doesn't really match up with Eternals on a thematic level, but it's the only one that makes sense. Ironically, it means all the MCU setup for Eternals was largely abandoned in the end.</p>
